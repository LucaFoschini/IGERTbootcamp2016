# Everything Data (IGERT Bootcamp, Day 3)

*Instructor:* [Luca Foschini](www.lucafoschini.com) (email: luca@evidation.com) (twitter: @calimagna)

*Format:* Lecture and hands-on

# Goals
- Learn how perform basic data manipulation with python
- See all the things that python can do
- Learn about what makes your code run slow
- Do you really have big data? 

## Recap
  The lecture on data science and tools for reproducibile science thaught by Ben Best can be found here: [here](https://github.com/bbest/ucsb-network-data-science-2016/)

## Data Ingestion, Wrangling, ETL

  - 80% of Data Science is data wrangling. 
  - Python's library ecosystem is the first reason to use it!
  - Pandas: if you learn one thing today, learn this!

## Why is my code slow?

  - Look under the hood: Memory hiearchies.
  - Python is magic, magic ain't free: how built-in types are implemented and efficiency consideration
  - Profiling and monitoring
  - If everything else fails: go parallel. 
  
## Data Exploration
  - Work with text, networks, time series. 
  - Examples, miniprojects, resources.
